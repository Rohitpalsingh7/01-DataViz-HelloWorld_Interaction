# Assignment-1
Introduction to Data Visualization using d3.js


// I used d3.js for completing my assignment 1 "Hello world" . It includes basic SVG primitive shapes and their involvment to create a simple visualization. 

1. Details of the visualization : 

This visualization depicts a boy standing in left part of the screen where he hits the ball and the ball travels till it falls in the basket kept in the center of the screen .

Once the ball lands to the basket , Two events occur, first is the bulging out of boys' eyes with different colors expressing the happiness and other represents the different colors of balls coming out from the basket. Both occuring simultaneously.

3. Technical and Design Achievements :

Technical Achievements :

In this visualization, I used HTML elements as DOM in D3 and all manipulations were done using d3.select() method.
It includes transition effects , delay and duration of these transitions. It also involves the rotation of a polygon (traingle filled with yellow color).

I also included the data binding concept with objects using d3, It helped me to create many circles dynamically even without defining them prior using HTML tags. So it saves time. I used the concepts of function() in D3 to assign different colors to the circle objects.

Design Achievements :

Manipulating DOM objects by giving real feel to various SVG elements that exhibits a small story that could be understood by looking at the visualization.
